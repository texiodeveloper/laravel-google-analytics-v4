## About Laravel Google Analytics v4

Retrieve all data like pageviews, events, ecommerce transactions and more from Google Analytics version 4 using the Google API.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require texlib/laravel-google-analytics
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="google-analytics-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Google Analytics ID
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The Google Analytics ID of the website you want to track.
    |
    */
    'property_id' => env('GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID', null),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Google Analytics Client Secret
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The Google Analytics Client Secret of the website you want to track.
    |
    */
    'credentials' => env('GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS', storage_path('app/analytics/google-credentials.json')),
];
```

## Usage

First you need to create a service account in the Google Cloud Console. You can find the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-php.

After you have created the service account, you need to download the credentials and save them in the `storage/app/analytics` folder. You can change the location of the credentials in the config file if you want.

After you have done this, you can use the package like this:

```php
use TexLib\Analytics\Facades\Analytics;
use TexLib\Analytics\Period;

// Get the average session duration for the last 7 days:
$averageSessionDuration = Analytics::averageSessionDuration(Period::days(7));
```

### Available periods

```php
// Set the period to the last x minutes:
Period::minutes(30);

// Set the period to the last x hours:
Period::hours(1);

// Set the period to the last x days:
Period::days(2);

// Set the period to the last x weeks:
Period::weeks(3);

// Set the period to the last x months:
Period::months(4);

// Set the period to the last x years:
Period::years(5);

// Set the period to a custom date range using a Carbon object:
$startDate = Carbon::now()->subDays(7);
$endDate = Carbon::now();

Period::create($startDate, $endDate);

// Set the period to since the given date:
Period::since(Carbon::now()->subDays(7));
```

> **Note:** Using multiple Carbon objects in the `Period::create()` method may possibly result in unexpected behaviour. It is recommended to pass the start and end date as a separate Carbon instance. For example: `Period::create(Carbon::instance($startDate), Carbon::instance($endDate))`. This will ensure that the start and end date are set correctly.
